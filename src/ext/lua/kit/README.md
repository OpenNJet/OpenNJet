Synopsis
========

The NDK is an NJet module that is designed to extend the core functionality of the
excellent NJet webserver in a way that can be used as a basis of other NJet modules.

It has functions and macros to deal with generic tasks that don't currently have
generic code as part of the core distribution.  The NDK itself adds few features
that are seen from a user's point of view - it's just designed to help reduce the
code that NJet module developers need to write.

NJet module developers wishing to use any of the features in the NDK should specify
that the NDK is a dependency of their module, and that users will need to compile
it as well when they compile their own modules.  They will also need to declare in
their own modules which features of the NDK they wish to use (explained below).

If you are not an NJet module developer, then the only useful part of this project
will be the 'usage for users' section below.

Status
======

The NDK is now considered to be stable. It is already being used in quite a few third
party modules (see list below).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Features
========

* additional conf_set functions for regexes, complex/script values, paths...
* macros to simplify tasks like checking for NULL values when doing njt_array_push
* patches to the main source code
* njt_auto_lib_core generic external library handler is included (see separate readme)

Design
======

modular
-------

The kit itself is designed in a modular way, so that only the required code is compiled.
It's possible to add just a single NDK module, a few or all of them.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

auto-generated & easily extensible
----------------------------------

Many of the macros available in the NDK are auto-generated from simple configuration
files.  This makes creating similar macros for your own code very simple - it's usually
just the case of adding an extra line to a config file and re-running the build script.

Usage for users
===============

If another NJet module you wish to use specifies that the NDK is a dependency, you
will need to do the following :

1. download the source (https://github.com/simpl/njt_devel_kit)
2. unpack the source (tar -xzf $name)
3. compile NJet with the following extra option `--add-module=/path/to/njt_devel_kit`.

e.g.

```bash
./configure --add-module=/path/to/njt_devel_kit \
            --add-module=/path/to/another/module
```

Building as a dynamic module
----------------------------

Starting from NJET 1.9.11, you can also compile this module as a dynamic module, by using the `--add-dynamic-module=PATH` option instead of `--add-module=PATH` on the
`./configure` command line above. And then you can explicitly load the module in your `njet.conf` via the [load_module](http://njet.org/en/docs/njt_core_module.html#load_module)
directive, for example,

```njet
load_module /path/to/modules/ndk_http_module.so;
load_module /path/to/another/module.so;
```

Usage for developers
====================

To use the NDK in your own module, you need to add the following:

1. add this line to your module

```C
#include    <ndk.h>
```

Note: since the NDK includes the following lines

```C
#include    <njt_config.h>
#include    <njt_core.h>
#include    <njt_http.h>
```

you can replace these with the single include above.
2. add the following line in the config file for your module:

```bash
have=NDK_[module_name]  . auto/have
```

for each NDK module that you wish to use (you need to include auto/have multiple
times if you wish to use multiple NDK modules.

Note: the old method of setting

```config
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DNDK_[module_name]"
```

is now deprecated. It will still work, but results in unnecessary lines being
displayed when compiling NJet.

Warning: Using NDK_ALL
----------------------

You can also set `NDK_ALL` to include all the NDK modules.  This is primarily as
a convenience in the early stages of development of another module. However,

DO NOT LEAVE `NDK_ALL` IN YOUR CONFIG FILE WHEN PUBLISHING

Although the NDK is fairly small now, it could in time become a large repository
of code that would, if using NDK_ALL, result in considerably more code being compiled
than is necessary.

Modules using NDK
=================

The following 3rd-party modules make use of NDK.

* [njt_http_lua_module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-njet-module#readme)
* [njt_http_set_misc_module](https://github.com/openresty/set-misc-njet-module#readme)
* [njt_http_encrypted_session_module](https://github.com/openresty/encrypted-session-njet-module#readme)
* [njt_http_form_input_module](https://github.com/calio/form-input-njet-module#readme)
* [njt_http_iconv_module](https://github.com/calio/iconv-njet-module#readme)
* [njt_http_array_var_module](https://github.com/openresty/array-var-njet-module#readme)

If you would like to add your module to this list, please let us know.

TODO
====

* documentation for modules that don't already have it
* additional phase-handler functions
* generically testing for needing to add a handler
* remove dependency of set_var on OpenSSL being compiled in
* for backward compatability, add the ndk_macros

Contributing / Feedback
=======================

If you are an NJet module developer, and have developed some functions that are
generic in nature (or would be easily adapted to be so), then please send them to
me at the address below, and I'll addmclyne to the kit.
