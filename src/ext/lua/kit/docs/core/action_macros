    GENERAL NOTES
    -------------

    These functions and macros have been provided as a tool for NJet module developers.  They have
    been created with four main purposes:

        - to speed up code-writing
        - to reduce the code you have to read on file
        - to add additional generic functionality similar to exising NJet functions 
        - to reduce code errors

    Most of the utility macros are just wrappers around commonly used code, especially checking for
    NULL and returning a value, zeroing data etc.  The functions add things like extra conf_set_X_slot
    functions that don't exist in the standard NJet distribution, but which might be useful in more
    than one module.

    A consistent approach has been taken to creating the macros, so that in theory you should be able
    to 'know' the macro name from using the few rules below and your knowledge of the existing NJet
    functions.  As much as possible, the ordering of variables used within the underlying functions
    remain the same, to reduce the learning time.  Also, a constent naming pattern has been used to
    make it easier to read the macros above.

    Obviously not all programmers will want to use all or any of these macros, but they are provided
    as a tool for those who wish to use them.

    If you have any comments about them, including any additions or errors please let me know at 
    'eugaia at gmail dot com'.  I don't promise to include all additions people send, but if they seem
    like they could be of use to multiple developers, I will.


    UTILITY MACRO PARAMS
    --------------------
    p       pointer                 - used to set the result of a function to a pointer
    a       array
    pl      pool
    n       multiplication factor   - for allocating multiple pointers & pushing 'n' elts in arrays etc
    sz      size
    l       log
    rv      return value



    UTILITY MACRO FUNCTION SUFFIXES
    -------------------------------

 - general

    p       p = [FUNCTION] ()
    _r      [ if result of function is NULL | NJT_ERROR (as appropriate) ] return rv
    _rce    rv = NJT_CONF_ERROR
    _re     rv = NJT_ERROR
    _rn     rv = NULL

 - (p)(c)alloc functions

    p       p = [function] (pool, sizeof (*p))
    pn      p = [function] (pool, sizeof (*p) * n)


    UTILITY MACRO PARAMS ORDER
    --------------------------
    p, pl|a, sz|n, l, rv
