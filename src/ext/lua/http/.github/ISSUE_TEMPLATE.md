This place is for bug reports and development discussions only. For general questions and
discussions, please join the openresty-en mailing list instead: https://openresty.org/en/community.html

Ensure you have provided the following details while reporting a problem:

* The exact version of the related software, including but not limited to the OpenResty version
(if any), the NGINX core version, the `njt_lua` module version,
and your operating system version.
* A minimal and standalone test case that others can easily run on their side and
reproduce the issue you are seeing.
* Do not simply say "something is broken" or "something does not work". Always provide
as much details as possible. Always describe the symptoms and your expected results.
* You can (temporarily) enable the nginx debugging logs to see the internal workings
of NGINX in your nginx''s `error.log` file. See http://nginx.org/en/docs/debugging_log.html
The same instructions apply equally well to OpenResty.
* If you are seeing crashes, please provide the full backtrace for the crash. See
https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/debugging/#core-dump
for more details.
