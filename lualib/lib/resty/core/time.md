This Lua module is currently considered production ready.

Synopsis
========

```nginx
location = /t {
    content_by_lua_block {
        local time = require "resty.core.time"
        ngx.say(time.monotonic_time())
        ngx.say(time.monotonic_msec())
    }
}
```

The value get by `"resty.core.time".monotonic_time` should equal to the value from /proc/uptime.

Methods
=======

monotonic_msec
--------------

**syntax:** *monotonic_msec()*

Returns the elapsed time in milliseconds from the machine boot for the current time stamp from the Nginx cached time (no syscall involved unlike Lua's date library).

```lua
local cur_msec = require "resty.core.time".monotonic_msec
ngx.say(cur_msec())

```

This api was first introduced in lua-resty-core v0.1.25.

monotonic_time
--------------

**syntax:** *monotonic_time()*

Returns a floating-point number for the elapsed time in seconds (including milliseconds as the decimal part) from the machine boot for the current time stamp from the Nginx cached time (no syscall involved unlike Lua's date library).

```lua
local cur_time = require "resty.core.time".monotonic_time
ngx.say(cur_time())

```

This api was first introduced in lua-resty-core v0.1.25.
